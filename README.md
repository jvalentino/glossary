# The Big-Bad Software Glossary

When writing documentation involving software, I seem to always find myself adding a glossary to avoid cluttering with definitions and explanations. I started this wiki as an attempt to consolidate all those different glossaries, and give a single place I can link to with common definitions.

### Android OS

> Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and commercially sponsored by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007, with the first commercial Android device, the HTC Dream, being launched in September 2008.
>
> Most versions of Android are proprietary. The core components are taken from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is free and open-source software (FOSS) primarily licensed under the Apache License. When Android is installed on devices, ability to modify the otherwise FOSS software is usually restricted, either by not providing the corresponding source code or preventing reinstallation through technical measures, rendering the installed version proprietary. Most Android devices ship with additional proprietary software pre-installed,[4] most notably Google Mobile Services (GMS)[5] which includes core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform Google Play, and associated Google Play Services development platform.

### API Endpoints

> Simply put, an endpoint is one end of a communication channel. When an API interacts with another system, the touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints. For APIs, an endpoint can include a URL of a server or service. Each endpoint is the location from which APIs can access the resources they need to carry out their function.
>
> APIs work using ‘requests’ and ‘responses.’ When an API requests information from a web application or web server, it will receive a response. The place that APIs send requests and where the resource lives, is called an endpoint.

### API Key

> An application programming interface (API) key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or calling program to an API.[1] However, they are typically used to authenticate a project with the API rather than a human user.[1][2] Different platforms may implement and use API keys in different ways.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_key

### Application Programming Interface (API)

> An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation

### Application Software

> An application program (software application, or application, or app for short) is a computer program designed to carry out a specific task other than one relating to the operation of the computer itself,[1] typically to be used by end-users.[2] Word processors, media players, and accounting software are examples. The collective noun "application software" refers to all applications collectively.[3] The other principal classifications of software are system software, relating to the operation of the computer, and utility software ("utilities").

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software

### App store

> An app store (or app marketplace) is a type of digital distribution platform for computer software called applications, often in a mobile context. Apps provide a specific set of functions which, by definition, do not include the running of the computer itself. Complex software designed for use on a personal computer, for example, may have a related app designed for use on a mobile device. Today apps are normally designed to run on a specific operating system—such as the contemporary iOS, macOS, Windows or Android—but in the past mobile carriers had their own portals for apps and related media content.[1]

### Artificially Intelligent Image Recognition

> Image recognition employs deep learning which is an advanced form of machine learning. Machine learning works by taking data as an input, applying various ML algorithms on the data to interpret it, and giving an output. Deep learning is different than machine learning because it employs a layered neural network. The three types of layers; input, hidden, and output are used in deep learning. The data is received by the input layer and passed on to the hidden layers for processing. As the name suggests the output layer generates the result. The layers are interconnected, and each layer depends on the other for the result. To train a neural network for deep learning, we need a huge dataset. We can say that deep learning imitates the human logical reasoning process and learns continuously from the data set. The neural network used for image recognition is known as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

**Availability***In reliability engineering, the term availability has the following meanings:*
*The degree to which a system, subsystem or equipment is in a specified operable and committable state at the start of a mission, when the mission is called for at an unknown, i.e. a random, time.**The probability that an item will operate satisfactorily at a given point in time when used under stated conditions in an ideal support environment.**Normally high availability systems might be specified as 99.98%, 99.999% or 99.9996%.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability
**Backend***In software engineering, the terms frontend and backend (or sometimes referred to as back end or back-end) refer to the separation of concerns between the presentation layer (frontend), and the data access layer (backend) of a piece of software, or the physical infrastructure or hardware. In the client–server model, the client is usually considered the frontend and the server is usually considered the backend, even when some presentation work is actually done on the server itself.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend
**Backend-for-Frontend***Backend For Frontend (BFF) architecture is the key to enhanced and improved user experience. A BFF layer consists of multiple backends developed to address the needs of respective frontend frameworks, like desktop, browser, and native-mobile apps. One of the biggest appeals of BFF is it ensures seamless user interaction regardless of the platform the frontend application is running on. It also enhances the overall efficiency of smart devices’ as the applications developed following BFF architecture optimize resource usage while the application is in use. In BFF, there are APIs for specific uses; significantly reducing the surface area that needs to be secured while greatly enhancing user confidence.*https://www.mobilelive.ca/blog/why-backend-for-frontend-application-architecture
**Barcode***A barcode or bar code is a method of representing data in a visual, machine-readable form. Initially, barcodes represented data by varying the widths, spacings and sizes of parallel lines. These barcodes, now commonly referred to as linear or one-dimensional (1D), can be scanned by special optical scanners, called barcode readers, of which there are several types. Later, two-dimensional (2D) variants were developed, using rectangles, dots, hexagons and other patterns, called matrix codes or 2D barcodes, although they do not use bars as such. 2D barcodes can be read using purpose-built 2D optical scanners, which exist in a few different forms. 2D barcodes can also be read by a digital camera connected to a microcomputer running software that takes a photographic image of the barcode and analyzes the image to deconstruct and decode the 2D barcode. A mobile device with an inbuilt camera, such as smartphone, can function as the latter type of 2D barcode reader using specialized application software (The same sort of mobile device could also read 1D barcodes, depending on the application software).*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode
**Big Data***Big data refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many fields (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[2] Big data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[3] The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. Thus a fourth concept, veracity, refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data. Without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity, then the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization's capacity to create and capture value from big data.[4]*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data

**Bluetooth***Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology standard that is used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances and building personal area networks (PANs). It employs UHF radio waves in the ISM bands, from 2.402 GHz to 2.48 GHz.[3] It is mainly used as an alternative to wire connections, to exchange files between nearby portable devices and connect cell phones and music players with wireless headphones. In the most widely used mode, transmission power is limited to 2.5 milliwatts, giving it a very short range of up to 10 metres (33 ft).*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth
**CAP Theorem***No distributed system is safe from network failures, thus network partitioning generally has to be tolerated.[7][8] In the presence of a partition, one is then left with two options: consistency or availability. When choosing consistency over availability, the system will return an error or a time out if particular information cannot be guaranteed to be up to date due to network partitioning. When choosing availability over consistency, the system will always process the query and try to return the most recent available version of the information, even if it cannot guarantee it is up to date due to network partitioning.*
*In the absence of a partition, both availability and consistency can be satisfied.[9]*
*Database systems designed with traditional ACID guarantees in mind such as RDBMS choose consistency over availability, whereas systems designed around the BASE philosophy, common in the NoSQL movement for example, choose availability over consistency.[5]*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem
**Centralized Logging***Centralized logging is the process of collecting logs from networks, infrastructure, and applications into a single location for storage and analysis. This can provide administrators with a consolidated view of all activity across the network, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot issues*https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/observability/centralized-logging/
**Cloud Computing***Cloud computing[1] is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.[2] Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically uses a "pay as you go" model, which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for users.[3]*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing
**Cloud Native***Cloud native computing is an approach in software development that utilizes cloud computing to "build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds".[1][2] These technologies such as containers, microservices, serverless functions and immutable infrastructure, deployed via declarative code are common elements of this architectural style.[3][4] Cloud native technologies focus on minimizing users' operational burden.[5][6]*
*These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_native_computing
**Command Query Response Segregation (CQRS)***CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. It's a pattern that I first heard described by Greg Young. At its heart is the notion that you can use a different model to update information than the model you use to read information. For some situations, this separation can be valuable, but beware that for most systems CQRS adds risky complexity.*
*The mainstream approach people use for interacting with an information system is to treat it as a CRUD datastore. By this I mean that we have mental model of some record structure where we can create new records, read records, update existing records, and delete records when we're done with them. In the simplest case, our interactions are all about storing and retrieving these records.*
*As our needs become more sophisticated we steadily move away from that model. We may want to look at the information in a different way to the record store, perhaps collapsing multiple records into one, or forming virtual records by combining information for different places. On the update side we may find validation rules that only allow certain combinations of data to be stored, or may even infer data to be stored that's different from that we provide.*https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html
**Computer Hardware***Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the case, central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard.*
*By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is "soft" because it is easy to change.*
*Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware
**Computer Vision***Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.*
*Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision
**Consumption Economics***If you're a tech company, the most dramatic effect of megatrends like cloud computing, managed services, and the rise of consumer technology won't be felt in your company's product line. The true disruption will be to your business model. Future customers won't want to pay you high prices out of big CapEx budgets anymore. They will expect lower cloud prices paid from OpEx budgets only when and if they successfully consume the business value of your products.How your company reacts to this risk shift could either accelerate the commoditization of your products or lead you to a new stage of profitable growth. For the first time, the tools are on the table to truly eliminate barriers of cost and complexity created by the last generation of tech. Consumption Economics is the owner's manual for tech company executives who want to drive their company successfully into the next one.*https://www.amazon.com/Consumption-Economics-New-Rules-Tech/dp/0984213031
**Database***In computing, a database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data modeling, efficient data representation and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database
**Data Fusion***Data fusion is the process of integrating multiple data sources to produce more consistent, accurate, and useful information than that provided by any individual data source.*
*Data fusion processes are often categorized as low, intermediate, or high, depending on the processing stage at which fusion takes place.[1] Low-level data fusion combines several sources of raw data to produce new raw data. The expectation is that fused data is more informative and synthetic than the original inputs.*
*For example, sensor fusion is also known as (multi-sensor) data fusion and is a subset of information fusion.*
*The concept of data fusion has origins in the evolved capacity of humans and animals to incorporate information from multiple senses to improve their ability to survive. For example, a combination of sight, touch, smell, and taste may indicate whether a substance is edible.[2]*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_fusion
**Desktop Computer***A desktop computer is a personal computer designed for regular use at a single location on or near a desk due to its size and power requirements. The most common configuration has a case that houses the power supply, motherboard (a printed circuit board with a microprocessor as the central processing unit, memory, bus, certain peripherals and other electronic components), disk storage (usually one or more hard disk drives, solid state drives, optical disc drives, and in early models a floppy disk drive); a keyboard and mouse for input; and a computer monitor, speakers, and, often, a printer for output. The case may be oriented horizontally or vertically (the latter configuration referred to as a tower) and placed either underneath, beside, or on top of a desk.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer
**DevOps***DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.[1] DevOps is complementary to Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile way of working.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps
**Distributed Cache***In computing, a distributed cache is an extension of the traditional concept of cache used in a single locale. A distributed cache may span multiple servers so that it can grow in size and in transactional capacity. It is mainly used to store application data residing in database and web session data. The idea of distributed caching[1] has become feasible now because main memory has become very cheap and network cards have become very fast, with 1 Gbit now standard everywhere and 10 Gbit gaining traction.[when?] Also, a distributed cache works well on lower cost machines usually employed for web servers as opposed to database servers which require expensive hardware.[2] An emerging internet architecture known as Information-centric networking (ICN) is one of the best examples of a distributed cache network. The ICN is a network level solution hence the existing distributed network cache management schemes are not well suited for ICN.[3] In the supercomputer environment, distributed cache is typically implemented in the form of burst buffer.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cache
**Domain Driven Design***Domain-driven design (DDD) is a major software design approach,[1] focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.[2]*
*Under domain-driven design, the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. For example, if software processes loan applications, it might have classes like LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.*
*Domain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:**placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;**basing complex designs on a model of the domain;**initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design
**Domain Model***In software engineering, a domain model is a conceptual model of the domain that incorporates both behavior and data.[1][2] In ontology engineering, a domain model is a formal representation of a knowledge domain with concepts, roles, datatypes, individuals, and rules, typically grounded in a description logic.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model
**End User***In product development, an end user (sometimes end-user)[a] is a person who ultimately uses or is intended to ultimately use a product.[1][2][3] The end user stands in contrast to users who support or maintain the product,[4] such as sysops, system administrators, database administrators,[5] Information technology (IT) experts, software professionals and computer technicians. End users typically do not possess the technical understanding or skill of the product designers,[6] a fact easily overlooked and forgotten by designers: leading to features creating low customer satisfaction.[2] In information technology, end users are not "customers" in the usual sense—they are typically employees of the customer.[7] For example, if a large retail corporation buys a software package for its employees to use, even though the large retail corporation was the "customer" which purchased the software, the end users are the employees of the company, who will use the software at work.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user
**Event Aggregator**An event aggregator is a special type of custom software application within an [Event-driven architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCpOlRvKDiBTlseeeU2U_KCreLbPWZO7YOPQZ4PMMvs/edit#bookmark=id.vf804j90fpex), in which its purpose is to stream events from an [Event Bus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCpOlRvKDiBTlseeeU2U_KCreLbPWZO7YOPQZ4PMMvs/edit#bookmark=id.jgofikniis50) and turn the relevant events into domain specific state representations within a database.
**Event Bus***Eventbuses are useful when you don't want components to depend on each other. Instead of a component having many references to other components, it can just send Events to an Eventbus and does not have to worry about who will take care of them.*http://www.rribbit.org/eventbus.html
**Event-driven Architecture***​​An event can be defined as "a significant change in state".[1] For example, when a consumer purchases a car, the car's state changes from "for sale" to "sold". A car dealer's system architecture may treat this state change as an event whose occurrence can be made known to other applications within the architecture. From a formal perspective, what is produced, published, propagated, detected or consumed is a (typically asynchronous) message called the event notification, and not the event itself, which is the state change that triggered the message emission. Events do not travel, they just occur. However, the term event is often used metonymically to denote the notification message itself, which may lead to some confusion. This is due to Event-driven architectures often being designed atop message-driven architectures, where such communication pattern requires one of the inputs to be text-only, the message, to differentiate how each communication should be handled.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture
**Fallacies of Distributed Computing***The fallacies of distributed computing are a set of assertions made by L Peter Deutsch and others at Sun Microsystems describing false assumptions that programmers new to distributed applications invariably make.**The fallacies are[1]**The network is reliable;**Latency is zero;**Bandwidth is infinite;**The network is secure;**Topology doesn't change;**There is one administrator;**Transport cost is zero;**The network is homogeneous.*
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing
**Foundation Foods***Foundation Foods includes values for nutrients and other food components on a diverse**range of foods and ingredients as well as extensive underlying metadata. These metadata**include the number of samples, sampling location, date of collection, analytical approaches**used, and if appropriate, agricultural information such as genotype and production practices.**The enhanced depth and transparency of Foundation Foods data can provide valuable insights**into the many factors that influence variability in nutrient and food component profiles. The**goal of Foundation Foods will be to, over time, expand the number of basic foods and**ingredients and their underlying data. Foundation Foods will be a primary focus of efforts as**FoodData central expands and develops in coming years*https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/docs/Foundation_Foods_Documentation_Apr2022.pdf
**Gherkin**Gherkin is a plain-text language with a simple structure. It is designed to be easy to learn by non-programmers, yet structured enough to allow concise description of test scenarios and examples to illustrate business rules in most real-world domains.

**Google Chat***Google Chat (formerly known as Hangouts Chat) is a communication service developed by Google. Initially designed for teams and business environments, it has since been made available for general consumers. It provides direct message, group conversations, and spaces, which allow users to create and assign tasks and share files in a central place in addition to chatting. It can be accessed through its own website and app or through the Gmail website and app.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chat
**Graphical User Interface (GUI)***The GUI (/ˌdʒiːjuːˈaɪ/ JEE-yoo-EYE[1][Note 1] or /ˈɡuːi/[2] GOO-ee), graphical user interface, is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based UIs, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of CLIs (command-line interfaces),[3][4][5] which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface
**High Availability (HA)***High availability (HA) is a characteristic of a system which aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime, for a higher than normal period.*
*Modernization has resulted in an increased reliance on these systems. For example, hospitals and data centers require high availability of their systems to perform routine daily activities. Availability refers to the ability of the user community to obtain a service or good, access the system, whether to submit new work, update or alter existing work, or collect the results of previous work. If a user cannot access the system, it is – from the user's point of view – unavailable.[1] Generally, the term downtime is used to refer to periods when a system is unavailable.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability
**Iceberg Analogy***If something is said to be 'the tip of the iceberg', it means that something is only a small part of a much bigger situation. This idiom comes from the fact that only the tip of an iceberg can be seen and the rest of the iceberg, which is much larger, is underneath the water and cannot be seen.*https://blogs.missouristate.edu/international/2020/05/27/idiom-tip-of-the-iceberg/
**iOS***iOS (formerly iPhone OS[10]) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware. It is the operating system that powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone; the term also included the versions running on iPads until iPadOS was introduced in 2019, as well as on the iPod Touch devices, which were discontinued in mid-2022.[11] It is the world's second-most widely installed mobile operating system, after Android. It is the basis for three other operating systems made by Apple: iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS. It is proprietary software, although some parts of it are open source under the Apple Public Source License and other licenses.[12]*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS
**Laptop***A laptop, laptop computer, or notebook computer is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a screen and alphanumeric keyboard. Laptops typically have a clam shell form factor with the screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid and the keyboard on the inside of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a "laptop mode".[1][2] Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.[3] They are so named because they can be practically placed on a person's lap when being used. Today, laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for playing games, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop
**Mac OS***The family of Mac operating systems developed by Apple Inc. includes the graphical user interface-based operating systems it has designed for use with its Mac series of personal computers since 1984, as well as the related system software it once created for compatible third-party systems.*
*In 1984, Apple debuted the operating system that is now known as the "Classic" Mac OS with its release of the original Macintosh System Software. The system, rebranded "Mac OS" in 1996, was preinstalled on every Macintosh until 2002 and offered on Macintosh clones for a short time in the 1990s. Noted for its ease of use, it was also criticized for its lack of modern technologies compared to its competitors.[1][2]*
*The current Mac operating system is macOS, originally named "Mac OS X" until 2012 and then "OS X" until 2016.[3] Developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple's purchase of NeXT, Mac OS X brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP, a Unix system, that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced. The current macOS is preinstalled with every Mac and receives a major update annually.[4] It is the basis of Apple's current system software for its other devices – iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.[5*]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_operating_systems
**Microservices***A microservice architecture – a variant of the service-oriented architecture structural style – is an architectural pattern that arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled, fine-grained services, communicating through lightweight protocols. One of its goals is that teams can develop and deploy their services independently of others. This is achieved by the reduction of several dependencies in the code base, allowing for developers to evolve their services with limited restrictions from users, and for additional complexity to be hidden from users.[1] As a consequence, organizations are able to develop software with fast growth and size, as well as use off-the-shelf services more easily. Communication requirements are reduced. These benefits come at a cost to maintaining the decoupling. Interfaces need to be designed carefully and treated as a public API. One technique that is used is having multiple interfaces on the same service, or multiple versions of the same service, so as to not disrupt existing users of the code.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices
**Microsoft Teams***Microsoft Teams is a proprietary business communication platform developed by Microsoft, as part of the Microsoft 365 family of products. Teams primarily competes with the similar service Slack, offering workspace chat and videoconferencing, file storage, and application integration.[7] Teams is replacing other Microsoft-operated business messaging and collaboration platforms, including Skype for Business and Microsoft Classroom. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Teams, and other software such as Zoom and Google Meet, gained much interest as many meetings moved to a virtual environment.[8] As of 2022, it has about 270 million monthly users.[9]*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Teams
**Monitoring and Alerting***A set of software components used for data collection, their processing, and presentation is called a monitoring system. Alerting is the capability of a monitoring system to detect and notify the operators about meaningful events that denote a grave change of state.*https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-monitoring-and/9781449333515/ch01.html
**New Relic***New Relic is a Software as a Service offering that focuses on performance and availability monitoring. It uses a standardized Apdex (application performance index) score to set and rate application performance across the environment in a unified manner.*https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/manage/tool_new_relic/
**Non-functional requirement***In systems engineering and requirements engineering, a non-functional requirement (NFR) is a requirement that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours. They are contrasted with functional requirements that define specific behavior or functions. The plan for implementing functional requirements is detailed in the system design. The plan for implementing non-functional requirements is detailed in the system architecture, because they are usually architecturally significant requirements.[1]*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement
**NoSQL Database***A NoSQL (originally referring to "non-SQL" or "non-relational")[1] database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but the name "NoSQL" was only coined in the early 21st century,[2] triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies.[3][4] NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications.[5] NoSQL systems are also sometimes called Not only SQL to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages or sit alongside SQL databases in polyglot-persistent architectures.[6][7]*
*Motivations for this approach include simplicity of design, simpler "horizontal" scaling to clusters of machines (which is a problem for relational databases),[2] finer control over availability and limiting the object-relational impedance mismatch.[8] The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key–value pair, wide column, graph, or document) are different from those used by default in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL. The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve. Sometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are also viewed as "more flexible" than relational database tables.[9]*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL
**One-to-many (data model)***In systems analysis, a one-to-many relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities (see also entity–relationship model) A and B in which an element of A may be linked to many elements of B, but a member of B is linked to only one element of A. For instance, think of A as books, and B as pages. A book can have many pages, but a page can only be in one book.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-many_(data_model)
**Operating System***An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.*
*Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.*
*For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,[1][2] although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer – from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.*
*The dominant general-purpose personal computer operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around 74.99%. macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place (14.84%), and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place (2.81%).[3] In the mobile sector (including smartphones and tablets), Android's share is 70.82% in the year 2020.[4] According to third quarter 2016 data, Android's share on smartphones is dominant with 87.5 percent with a growth rate of 10.3 percent per year, followed by Apple's iOS with 12.1 percent with per year decrease in market share of 5.2 percent, while other operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent.[5] Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors. Other specialized classes of operating systems (special-purpose operating systems),[6][7] such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications. Security-focused operating systems also exist. Some operating systems have low system requirements (e.g. light-weight Linux distribution). Others may have higher system requirements.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system
**Partition Tolerance***The CAP Theorem is based on three trade-offs: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Partition tolerance, in this context, means the ability of a data processing system to continue processing data even if a network partition causes communication errors between subsystems.[1]*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_partition
**Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** *Connolly and Begg define Database Management System (DBMS) as a "software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database".[18] RDBMS is an extension of that acronym that is sometimes used when the underlying database is relational.*
*An alternative definition for a relational database management system is a database management system (DBMS) based on the relational model. Most databases in widespread use today are based on this model.[19]*
*RDBMSs have been a common option for the storage of information in databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical information, personnel data, and other applications since the 1980s. Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases and network databases, because RDBMS were easier to implement and administer. Nonetheless, relational stored data received continued, unsuccessful challenges by object database management systems in the 1980s and 1990s, (which were introduced in an attempt to address the so-called object–relational impedance mismatch between relational databases and object-oriented application programs), as well as by XML database management systems in the 1990s.[citation needed] However, due to the expanse of technologies, such as horizontal scaling of computer clusters, NoSQL databases have recently become popular as an alternative to RDBMS databases.[20]*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#RDBMS
**REST***Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that describes a uniform interface between physically separate components, often across the Internet in a client-server architecture.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer
**Session***In computer science and networking in particular, a session is a time-delimited two-way link, a practical (relatively high) layer in the tcp/ip protocol enabling interactive expression and information exchange between two or more communication devices or ends – be they computers, automated systems, or live active users (see login session). A session is established at a certain point in time, and then ‘torn down’ - brought to an end - at some later point. An established communication session may involve more than one message in each direction. A session is typically stateful, meaning that at least one of the communicating parties needs to hold current state information and save information about the session history to be able to communicate, as opposed to stateless communication, where the communication consists of independent requests with responses.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_(computer_science)
**Slack***Slack is an instant messaging program designed by Slack Technologies and owned by Salesforce. Although Slack was developed for professional and organizational communications, it has been adopted as a community platform.[12] Users can communicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats or as part of communities called "workspaces". Slack also uses IRC-style features such as persistent chat rooms (channels) organized by topic, private groups, and direct messaging. In addition to these online communication features, Slack integrates with other software.[13] Slack runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, Windows Phone and iOS.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)
**Smart Device***A smart device is an electronic device, generally connected to other devices or networks via different wireless protocols (such as Bluetooth, Zigbee, near-field communication, Wi-Fi, LiFi, or 5G) that can operate to some extent interactively and autonomously. Several notable types of smart devices are smartphones, smart cars, smart thermostats, smart doorbells, smart locks, smart refrigerators, phablets and tablets, smartwatches, smart bands, smart keychains, smart glasses, and many others. The term can also refer to a device that exhibits some properties of ubiquitous computing, including—although not necessarily—machine learning.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_device
**Smartphone***A smartphone is a portable computer device that combines mobile telephone and computing functions into one unit. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chips, include various sensors that can be leveraged by pre-included and third-party software (such as a magnetometer, proximity sensors, barometer, gyroscope, accelerometer and more), and support wireless communications protocols (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite navigation).*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone
**Smart Plate**A Smart Plate is a [Computer Hardware](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCpOlRvKDiBTlseeeU2U_KCreLbPWZO7YOPQZ4PMMvs/edit#bookmark=id.dmgi66a8ylh9) device that is capable of weighing food, and otherwise using specialized [Computer Vision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCpOlRvKDiBTlseeeU2U_KCreLbPWZO7YOPQZ4PMMvs/edit#bookmark=id.lqafs12bbs54) [Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZCpOlRvKDiBTlseeeU2U_KCreLbPWZO7YOPQZ4PMMvs/edit#bookmark=id.sozearnizwn) for identifying the specific food placed on that device.
**Smartglasses***Smartglasses or smart glasses are eye or head-worn wearable computers that offer useful capabilities to the user. Many smartglasses include displays that add information alongside or to what the wearer sees.[1][2][3] Alternatively, smartglasses are sometimes defined as glasses that are able to change their optical properties, such as smart sunglasses that are programmed to change tint by electronic means.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses
**Smartscale***Many scales estimate body composition through bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Smart scales measure BIA by having two electrodes that send a painless electrical current through your left and right feet. It's important to have your socks and shoes off to use this feature*https://www.goodrx.com/healthcare-access/digital-health/smart-scales
**Smartwatch***A smartwatch is a wearable computer in the form of a watch; modern smartwatches provide a local touchscreen interface for daily use, while an associated smartphone app provides for management and telemetry (such as long-term biomonitoring). While early models could perform basic tasks, such as calculations, digital time telling, translations, and game-playing, smartwatches released since 2015 have more general functionality closer to smartphones, including mobile apps, a mobile operating system and WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity. Some smartwatches function as portable media players, with FM radio and playback of digital audio and video files via a Bluetooth headset. Some models, called watch phones (or phone watches), have mobile cellular functionality like making calls.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch
**SMS***Short Message/Messaging Service, commonly abbreviated as SMS, is a text messaging service component of most telephone, Internet and mobile device systems. It uses standardized communication protocols that let mobile devices exchange short text messages. An intermediary service can facilitate a text-to-voice conversion to be sent to landlines.[1]*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS
**Software***Software is a set of computer programs and associated documentation and data. This is in contrast to hardware, from which the system is built and which actually performs the work.*
*At the lowest programming level, executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU). Machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the user. The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to "jump" to a different instruction, or is interrupted by the operating system. As of 2015, most personal computers, smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together, and computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software
**Software as a Service (SaaS)***Software as a service (SaaS /sæs/[1]) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.[2][3] SaaS is also known as "on-demand software" and Web-based/Web-hosted software.[4]*
*SaaS is considered to be part of cloud computing, along with infrastructure as a service (IaaS),[5] platform as a service (PaaS), desktop as a service (DaaS), managed software as a service (MSaaS), mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), data center as a service (DCaaS), integration platform as a service (iPaaS), and information technology management as a service (ITMaaS).[6]*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service
**Software Development Kit (SDK)***A software development kit (SDK) is a collection of software development tools in one installable package. They facilitate the creation of applications by having a compiler, debugger and sometimes a software framework. They are normally specific to a hardware platform and operating system combination.[1][2][3] To create applications with advanced functionalities such as advertisements,[4] push notifications,[5] etc; most application software developers use specific software development kits.[6]*
*Some SDKs are required for developing a platform-specific app. For example, the development of an Android app on the Java platform requires a Java Development Kit. For iOS applications (apps) the iOS SDK is required. For Universal Windows Platform the .NET Framework SDK might be used. There are also SDKs that add additional features and can be installed in apps to provide analytics, data about application activity, and monetization options. Some prominent creators of these types of SDKs include Google,[7] Smaato,[8] InMobi,[9] and Facebook.[10]*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit
**Sub-system***A system is a group of interacting or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole.[1] A system, surrounded and influenced by its environment, is described by its boundaries, structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning. Systems are the subjects of study of systems theory and other systems sciences.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System
**Superuser**In computing, the superuser is a special user account used for system administration. Depending on the operating system (OS), the actual name of this account might be root, administrator, admin or supervisor. In some cases, the actual name of the account is not the determining factor; on Unix-like systems, for example, the user with a user identifier (UID) of zero is the superuser, regardless of the name of that account;[1] and in systems which implement a role based security model, any user with the role of superuser (or its synonyms) can carry out all actions of the superuser account. The principle of least privilege recommends that most users and applications run under an ordinary account to perform their work, as a superuser account is capable of making unrestricted, potentially adverse, system-wide changes.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser
**System***A system is a group of interacting or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole.[1] A system, surrounded and influenced by its environment, is described by its boundaries, structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning. Systems are the subjects of study of systems theory and other systems sciences.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System
**System Administrator***A system administrator, or sysadmin, or admin is a person who is responsible for the upkeep, configuration, and reliable operation of computer systems, especially multi-user computers, such as servers. The system administrator seeks to ensure that the uptime, performance, resources, and security of the computers they manage meet the needs of the users, without exceeding a set budget when doing so.*
*To meet these needs, a system administrator may acquire, install, or upgrade computer components and software; provide routine automation; maintain security policies; troubleshoot; train or supervise staff; or offer technical support for projects.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator
**System Architecture***A system architecture is the conceptual model that defines the structure, behavior, and more views of a system.[1] An architecture description is a formal description and representation of a system, organized in a way that supports reasoning about the structures and behaviors of the system.*
*A system architecture can consist of system components and the sub-systems developed, that will work together to implement the overall system. There have been efforts to formalize languages to describe system architecture, collectively these are called architecture description languages (ADLs)*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_architecture
**Terms of Service***Terms of service (also known as terms of use and terms and conditions, commonly abbreviated as TOS or ToS, ToU or T&C) are the legal agreements between a service provider and a person who wants to use that service. The person must agree to abide by the terms of service in order to use the offered service.[1] Terms of service can also be merely a disclaimer, especially regarding the use of websites. Vague language and lengthy sentences used in the terms of use have brought concerns on customer privacy and raised public awareness in many ways.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service
**Universal Product Code (UPC)***The Universal Product Code (UPC or UPC code) is a barcode symbology that is widely used worldwide for tracking trade items in stores.*
*UPC (technically refers to UPC-A) consists of 12 digits that are uniquely assigned to each trade item. Along with the related International Article Number (EAN) barcode, the UPC is the barcode mainly used for scanning of trade items at the point of sale, per the specifications of the international GS1 organisation.[1] UPC data structures are a component of Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) and follow the global GS1 specification, which is based on international standards. But some retailers (clothing, furniture) do not use the GS1 system (rather other barcode symbologies or article number systems). On the other hand, some retailers use the EAN/UPC barcode symbology, but without using a GTIN (for products sold in their own stores only).*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code
**Use Case***A use case is a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role (known in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as an actor) and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or other external system. In systems engineering, use cases are used at a higher level than within software engineering, often representing missions or stakeholder goals. The detailed requirements may then be captured in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) or as contractual statements.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case
**User Experience (UX)***The user experience (UX) is how a user interacts with and experiences a product, system or service. It includes a person's perceptions of utility, ease of use, and efficiency. Improving user experience is important to most companies, designers, and creators when creating and refining products because negative user experience can diminish the use of the product and, therefore, any desired positive impacts; conversely, designing toward profitability often conflicts with ethical user experience objectives and even causes harm. User experience is subjective. However, the attributes that make up the user experience are objective.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience
**Windows OS***Windows is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families developed and marketed by Microsoft. Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry, for example, Windows NT for consumers, Windows Server for servers, and Windows IoT for embedded systems. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile, and Windows Phone.*
*The first version of Windows was released on November 20, 1985, as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).[6]*
*Windows is the most popular desktop operating system in the world, with 75% market share as of April 2022, according to StatCounter.[7] However, Windows is not the most used operating system when including both mobile and desktop OSes, due to Android's massive growth.[8]*
*As of September 2022, the most recent version of Windows is Windows 11 for consumer PCs and tablets, Windows 11 Enterprise for corporations, and Windows Server 2022 for servers.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows
